### Data Scraping

The plan was to scrape all the data I need from basketball reference using beautifulsoup. I needed to get various data 
such as: 
- statistics per 100 possessions
- advanced stats 
- mvp for the season
- team standings for the season

I successfully completed getting stats per 100 possessions and advanced stats using soup but when I tried 
getting team standings for the season, it turns out the basketball reference page was using javascript. In order to get 
this data I had to use Selenium, which isn't too much of a problem as I wanted to learn how to use Selenium anyways.

If I were to redo this project I would probably just scrape using Selenium only from the start and exclude the 
scrapeWithSoup method, but for the purpose of learning both beautifulsoup and selenium, I decided to keep both methods.
